# Stanford Machine Learning - Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, and Reinforcement Learning

This is the third course in the **Stanford Machine Learning Specialization** offered on Coursera. In this course, you will dive deeper into three important areas of machine learning:

## Course Overview

In this course, we explore the fundamentals of:

1. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   Learn how to extract useful patterns and insights from unlabeled data. This includes techniques like clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

2. **Recommender Systems**  
   Understand the core concepts behind building recommendation engines. This section covers collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and evaluating recommender models.

3. **Reinforcement Learning**  
   Explore the world of reinforcement learning, where agents learn to make decisions by interacting with an environment. Key topics include Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), value iteration, and Q-learning.

## Key Topics Covered:

### 1. Unsupervised Learning
   - **Clustering**: K-means, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs)
   - **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA (Principal Component Analysis), t-SNE
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Methods to detect outliers in high-dimensional data

### 2. Recommender Systems
   - **Collaborative Filtering**: User-user and item-item filtering
   - **Matrix Factorization**: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Alternating Least Squares (ALS)
   - **Evaluation**: Techniques to evaluate the accuracy and effectiveness of recommender systems

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
   - **Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)**: Modeling sequential decision-making
   - **Value Iteration and Policy Iteration**: Methods to find optimal policies
   - **Q-learning**: Model-free reinforcement learning algorithm
